# SoundBridge

SoundBridge automatically syncs Spotify playlists to an offline MP3 music library.

## Why
I wanted to reduce reliance on streaming services, avoid phone distractions,
and enjoy intentional offline listening on a dedicated MP3 player.

## Features
- Detect new tracks added to Spotify playlists
- Normalize track metadata
- Search and match tracks on YouTube
- Fetch audio from configurable sources
- Apply ID3 tags and organize a local music library
- Sync music to a portable MP3 player

## Status
🚧 Under active development
